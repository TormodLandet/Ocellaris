Ocellaris
=========

A discontinuous Galerkin FEM solver for multiphase free surface flows. The current goal of the 
project is to simulate water entry and exit of objects in ocean waves.

Ocellaris is implemented in Python and C++. For numerics, mesh and finte element calculations 
FEniCS_ is used as the backend.

Ocellaris is named after the Amphiprion ocellaris Clownfish
