Ocellaris
=========

A discontinuous Galerkin FEM solver for multiphase free surface flows. The current goal of the 
project is to simulate water entry and exit of objects in ocean waves.

Ocellaris is implemented in Python and C++ with FEniCS_ as the backend for numerics, mesh and 
finte element calculations.

Ocellaris is named after the "Amphiprion Ocellaris" Clownfish.
