The Ocellaris web pages can now be found on `www.ocellaris.org <https://www.ocellaris.org/>`_ and the documentation there is also improved and updated. The source code repository has been moved to the `Ocellaris Project organization <https://bitbucket.org/ocellarisproject/ocellaris>`_ ob Bitbucket, which will hopefully make it easier to collaborate on the development of Ocellaris in the future.

In other news, you can now find Ocellaris releases on Zenodo, under DOI `10.5281/zenodo.2558302 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2558302>`_. To install Ocellaris the recommended way is still to use the prepared releases on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/ocellaris/>`_ through pip.

Ocellaris has also been submitted to the `Journal of Open Source Software <http://joss.theoj.org/>`_, see `this issue <https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1239>`_ for progress. Two more scientific papers using Ocellaris are also soon available as preprints, one on exactly divergence free pressure correction schemes for DG FEM and one on the 3D wave simulations shown earlier as videos on this blog.
