Programmers guide
=================

The programmers guide is meant for very advanced users and developers who want
to make changes to Ocellaris or extend the code in other ways than what is
possible by including Python code in the input file (see :ref:`inp_user_code`
and :ref:`user_guide_advanced_topics` in the user guide for how to do that).

This documentation shows the API of the most important classes and gives
information about scripting Ocellaris from outside. You will also find an
introduction which is meant to help you understand the main control flow of the
Ocellaris code base which can be useful if you want to make changes to
Ocellaris.
