User guide
==========

The Ocellaris user guide gives an introduction to installing, configuring and
running Ocellaris.

There are many possible simulations that can be correctly set up, but Ocellaris
will fail to give the physically correct answer. You must validate the code and
the configuration (input file) for your own purposes before trusting the results.
