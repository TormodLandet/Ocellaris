Known fields
============

Known fields can be used to specify boundary and initial conditions. If they
are the same then one field can be used for both avoiding repeated definitions.
Known fields can also be used to specify custom fields that cannot easily be
described in C++, like the regular wave fields that are implemented. Known
fields can also be used to specify damping zones in a domain.
